h2. Installation
==<hr />==

p. I have produced .deb and .rpm files of jiraclient, but there are some dependencies that are not generally available in those formats.  This leaves re-packaging into those formats as an exercise for the reader.  Otherwise, you can just download the code and run it from a home directory.  

p. {{ page.module_details.name }} depends on the following packages:

<pre class="terminal">
python
python-fpconst
python-soappy (SOAPpy)
python-yaml
python-xmlrpclib (xmlrpclib) # part of standard python
</pre>

p. After installing the dependencies, you will need git installed in order to clone the repository:

<pre class="terminal">
    git clone git://github.com/genome/jiraclient.git
    export PATH=~/jiraclient/src:$PATH
</pre>

{% include install/help.html %}

p. For more details, see the ["jiraclient README":https://github.com/genome/jiraclient/blob/master/README].
